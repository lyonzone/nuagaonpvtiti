    <h1>AN OVERVIEW OF APPRENTICESHIP TRAINING SCHEME</h1>
        <div class="aboutApprentice">
        	<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>
            <p>Development of human resource is crucial for the industrial development   of any nation.  Upgradation  of skills is an important component of Human Resource Development. Training imparted in Institutions alone is not sufficient for acquisition of skills and needs to be supplemented by training in the actual work place</p>
             <h2>OBJECTIVES</h2>
             <p><span style="color:#06F; font-size:13px;font-weight:bold">Apprentices Act, 1961 was enacted with the following objectives :</span><br />
				To regulate the programme of training of apprentices in the industry so as  to conform to the syllabi, period of training etc. as laid  down by  the  Central   Apprenticeship Council; and</p>
<p>To utilise fully  the  facilities available in industry for imparting practical training with a view to  meeting the  requirements  of skilled manpower    for industry.</p>

<p>The Act was again amended in 2008 to amend various sections of the Act as regards reservation for candidates belonging to Other Backward Classes (OBCs), expenditure on related instruction shall be imparted at the cost of employer and the employer shall, when so required, afford all facilities for imparting such instructions and to provide flexibility in respect of ratios prescribed for apprenticeship seats.</p>
